#Question:  What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating?  What question does it answer?  How clear is the team's explanation?
The team is working on an agent-based model that seeks to recreate the foraging patterns of army ants. The question the model answers seems to be something like: how do army ants forage food using only pheromones to see? The team clearly explains this in the abstract section.
#Methodology: Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?
Beyond a simple explanation of how a few parameters affect the ant, a more in depth explanation of how the system is implemented would be helpful. 
#Results: Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?
The current visuals are very cool and intuitively explain what the current state of the results are. Good labels and captions.
#Interpretation: Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?
The interpretation is missing from the report, results are shown but not discussed. 
#Replication: Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper?  If so, how did the authors demonstrate that consistency?  Is it quantitative or qualitative?
The team seems to be getting close to a replication of the original model using purely qualitative results. Looking at the paper it comes from, the results are also purely qualitative so it makes sense to use this as validation.  Having so many unknown variables makes close replication quite difficult, even more so when results are qualitative, so it makes sense there will be some deviation. 
#Extension: Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly?  Can it answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?
The extension is mentioned at the beginning but not really expanded on during the paper.
#Progress: Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?
The replication seems to be close to complete, the extension seems like it still has work to be done. 
#Presentation: Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language?  Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report?  Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guide
The paper is written well, with no noticeable spelling errors, and generally follows the format of style guide. 
#Mechanics: Is the report in the right directory with the right file name?  Is it formatted professionally in Markdown?  Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors?  Is the bibliography in an acceptable style? 
Yes to all of these.
