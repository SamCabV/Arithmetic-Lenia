# Question:  What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating?  What question does it answer?  How clear is the team's explanation?
My understanding of what the team is replicating is pretty clear, it is a model of army ant raid patterns based on the pheromones they put down. The explanation is pretty clear especially in the Experiment section.
# Methodology: Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?
I understand the methodology, it was succinctly described in the experiment section and makes sense for the question. However I did notice it seems to be incomplete (to be filled in later text was still there I assume for the extension.)
# Results: Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?
I understood the results however I was initially confused thinking the first few pictures were the results before actually seeing the results below them. It would be nice if the figures were titled.
# Interpretation: Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?
I did not see any interpretation in the draft.
# Replication: Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper?  If so, how did the authors demonstrate that consistency?  Is it quantitative or qualitative?
There seems to be some consistency with the original paper that is qualitative (compared pictures.)
# Extension: Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly?  Can it answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?
It does however it is mainly mentioned in the cause for concern section. I think the question it addresses is somewhat different as it derives from a different model but I see how they are connected.
# Progress: Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?
Seems good, though the cause for concern section was quite heavy.
# Presentation: Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language?  Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report?  Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guide (Links to an external site.)?
Yes, it looks good except for some missing parts and perhaps some labelling issues with images.
# Mechanics: Is the report in the right directory with the right file name?  Is it formatted professionally in Markdown?  Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors?  Is the bibliography in an acceptable style?
These all seem good.
